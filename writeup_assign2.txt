Description: 
- FaceBevel: normal movement is normal to the face, tangent movement follows the direction of middle of two edges vectors 

  a ---- b     for example, middle of b->a, c->a vector is how edge connected to point a moves along tangent 
   \    /
    \  /
     c

- EdgeCollapse: Implemented and tested on sphere and cube and cow. It works fine on the initial meshes but sometimes doesn't work on second or third collapse 
- EdgeFlip: working
- EdgeSplit: working, if non-triangle faces next to edge or it's boundary, no operation 
- Triangulation: working, implemented all the functionalities, tested on cube and dodecahedron 
- LinearSubdivision: working, test on sphere, teapot.dae
- CatmullClarkSubdivision: working, implemented and tested on cube and dodecahedron models
- Simplification: Most of the time, simplification is working. No simplification is performed if non-triangle mesh or edge count < 100. Add collapse_edge_j() to collapse edge to be used in simplify() as we are going to pass in optimal point, but end up using mid point in the submission. collapse_edge_j() is similar to collapse_edge() but without implementation of edge case. 
- Model: Dmitrii's family pet, dachshund Fox;I used both Cardinal3D and ZBrush to create this model. This is how it was generated step by step: 
1) I used ZBrush ZSphere brush to create a spherical skeleton for quadruped animal. I gave it all body proportions of Fox (long body, tail, legs) but no small details like eyes or ears. 
2) Then I generated a high resolution Dynamesh by skeleton and exported it to OBJ and then to Collada (.dae).
3) Imported .dae to Cardinal3D. The mesh was too highres for efficient editing. So I used simplify to reduce the resolution. 
4) Add small details: extruded chin, ears and added spherical eyes. 
5) Applied CatmullClark subdivision to get rid of small long triangles on long body.
