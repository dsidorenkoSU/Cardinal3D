Description: 
- FaceBevel: working. 
- EdgeCollapse: Implemented and tested on sphere and cube and cow. It works fine on the initial meshes but sometimes doesn't work on second or third collapse. 
- EdgeFlip: working.
- EdgeSplit: if non-triangle faces next to edge or it's boundary, no operation 
- Triangulation: Implemented all the functionality but it leaves some extra next links between halfedges. Will be fixed in after initial deadline 
- LinearSubdivision: working. 
- CatmullClarkSubdivision: Implemented and tested on cube and dodecahedron models
- Simplification: add collapse_edge_j() to collapse edge in simplify(). Most of the time, it's working. No simplification is performed if non-triangle mesh or edge count < 100. collapse_edge_j() is similar to collapse_edge() but without implementation of edge case. â€¨- Model:
