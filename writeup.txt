Description: 
- FaceBevel: N/A
- EdgeCollapse: Implemented and tested on sphere and cube and cow. It works fine on the initial meshes but sometimes doesn't work on second or third collapse. 
- EdgeFlip: 
- EdgeSplit: if non-triangle faces next to edge or it's boundary, no operation 
- Triangulation: Implemented all the functionality but it leaves some extra next links between halfedges. Will be fixed in after initial deadline 
- LinearSubdivision: N/A 
- CatmullClarkSubdivision: Implemented and tested on cube and dodecahedron models
- Simplification: implement all the functionality, but couldn't get it to work. 
- Model:
