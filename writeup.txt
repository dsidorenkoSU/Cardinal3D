Description: 
- FaceBevel: working 
- EdgeCollapse: Implemented and tested on sphere and cube and cow. It works fine on the initial meshes but sometimes doesn't work on second or third collapse. 
- EdgeFlip: working.
- EdgeSplit: working, if non-triangle faces next to edge or it's boundary, no operation 
- Triangulation: working, implemented all the functionality. Tested on cube and dodecahedron 
- LinearSubdivision: working. 
- CatmullClarkSubdivision: working, implemented and tested on cube and dodecahedron models
- Simplification: add collapse_edge_j() to collapse edge in simplify(). Most of the time, it's working. No simplification is performed if non-triangle mesh or edge count < 100. collapse_edge_j() is similar to collapse_edge() but without implementation of edge case.
